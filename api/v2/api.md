# dcrtime API Specification

## V2

This document describes the REST API provided by a `dcrtimed` server. This API 
allows users to create and upload hashes which are periodically submitted to 
the Decred blockchain. It gives the option to send a single string digest, as 
well as multiples in a array of string digests. It also provides the ability 
to confirm the addition of the hash to a timestamped collection along with 
showing and validating their inclusion in the Decred blockchain.

**Methods**

- [`Timestamp Batch`](#timestampBatch)
- [`Verify Batch`](#verifyBatch)

- [`Timestamp`](#timestamp)
- [`Verify`](#verify)

**Return Codes**

- [`ResultInvalid`](#ResultInvalid)
- [`ResultOK`](#ResultOK)
- [`ResultExistsError`](#ResultExistsError)
- [`ResultDoesntExistsError`](#ResultDoesntExistsError)
- [`ResultDisabled`](#ResultDisabled)

### Methods


#### `Timestamp Batch`

Upload multiple digests to the time server. The server adds this 
digest to a collection and eventually to a transaction that goes in a Decred 
block. This method returns immediately with the collection the digest has been 
added to. You must use the verify call to find out when it has been anchored to
a block (which is done in batches at a set time interval that is not related to
the api calls).

* **URL**

  `/v2/timestamp/batch`

* **HTTP Method:**

  `POST`

*  *Params*

	**Required**

   `digests=[{hash},{...}]`

    Digests is an array of digests (SHA256 hashes) to send to the server.

	**Optional**

   `id=[string]`

	ID is a user provided identifier that may be used in case the client 
	requires a unique identifier.

* **Results**

	`id`

	id is copied from the original call for the client to use to match calls
	 and responses.

	`servertimestamp`

	servertimestamp is the collection the digests belong to.

	`digests`

	digests is the list of digests processed by the server.

	`results`

	results is a list of integers representing the result for each digest.  
	See #Results for details on return codes.

* **Example**

Request:

```json
{
    "id":"dcrtime cli",
    "digests":[
        "d412ba345bc44fb6fbbaf2db9419b648752ecfcda6fd1aec213b45a5584d1b13"
    ]
}
```

Reply:

```json
{
    "id":"dcrtime cli",
	"servertimestamp":1497376800,
	"digests":[
	    "d412ba345bc44fb6fbbaf2db9419b648752ecfcda6fd1aec213b45a5584d1b13"
	],
	"results":[
	    1
	]
}
```

#### `Verify Batch`

Verifies the status of a batch of digests or timestamps on the server. If 
verifying digests, it'll return the chain information relative to that digest, 
including its merkle path. If verifying timestamps, it'll return the 
collection information relative to that timestamp, including all the digests 
grouped on that collection. If it has not been anchored on the blockchain yet, 
it returns zero. Digests and timestamps can be verified on the same request.

#### `Timestamp`

Upload one digest to the time server from a pure HTML form data on the client 
side. This route exists to serve no-JS clients. Anchors the digest to the
server the same way as batched ones.

  `/v2/timestamp`

* **HTTP Method:**

  `POST`

*  *Params*

	**Required**

   `digest={hash}`

    Digest is a digest (SHA256 hash) to send to the server.

	**Optional**

   `id=[string]`

	ID is a user provided identifier that may be used in case the client 
	requires a unique identifier.

* **Results**

	`id`

	id is copied from the original call for the client to use to match calls
	 and responses.

	`servertimestamp`

	servertimestamp is the collection the digests belong to.

	`digest`

	`result`

	result is a integer representing the result for the digest. See #Result
	 for details on return codes.
